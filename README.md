# FizzBusted
Exploring the mystery of the FizzBuzz Meme and that the Horrors might be in the testers themselves

The idea in germination here is to produce a UWP Demo that challenges the underlying FizzBuzz social assumptions and the cold stark inherent lack of conversation that FizzBuzz culture introduces to an already non-inclusive profession.

Feedback, comments, code, ideas, brainstorming, discussion, etc all very welcome via any channel. Open an "issue" just to say hello

# FizzBuzz Culture

- What type of organization would ask members or prospective members to take the FizzBuzz test?
- make a fictional company such as: "World Wide Dilbertian Associates Inc"

# FizzBuzz Objectives

- Promote your organization as focusing on the trivial
- Ensure all organization members are demoralized by the asymetric power relationship
- Communicate that creativity is not a desirable attribute

# FizzBusted Objectives

- point out the inherent absurdity of FizzBuzz through a "Spinal Tap" type of parody
- educate organizations that 1970's social research "The Medium is the Message" is still valid today
- although I personally think efforts like "Hour of Code" are based on false assumptions, mocking people with FizzBuzz is logically opposed to encouraging people to adopt programming
- there is a known psychological condition known as "Performance Anxiety" but of course in the usual context of evaluation potential organization members, FizzBuzz is just icing on top of the Horror Cake that is a typical selection process
- testing anything at all inevitably leads to selection based on testing which to the clueless seems like a desired outcome but in the end your are mostly selecting for ability to navigate artificial tests!
- similar to the problem of "testing selection" there is the meta result of "Mono Culture" in an organization. This is why Google has dropped its mythically famous programmer testing which they found (rather obviously IMO) that they ended up with excellent test takers and identical thinkers all talented to a huge degree in those areas but not contributing to the diversity and progress of the organizaton.
