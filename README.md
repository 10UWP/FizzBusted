# FizzBusted UWP

# FAQ

### Why present this in a UWP demo?

- Because even though we might have to navigate a maze of twisty little passages, all roads in the 10UWP Organization lead to UWP

### What is the target audience of this project?
- Humans that want to discover UWP programming as a fun, playful, enjoyable medium of expression
- Humans that have not yet been infected with the Dilbert Virus.
- mild technical level - appreciating the inherent parody in [FizzBuzz Enterprise Edition](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition) requires too much base knowledge for example and for anyone sitting on the cusp of that knowledge, runs the risk of not seeing the parody and actually adopting the style as a model.

# FizzBuzz Background

### FizzBusted
Exploring the mystery of the FizzBuzz Meme and that the Horrors might be in the testers themselves

The idea in germination here is to produce a UWP Demo that challenges the underlying FizzBuzz social assumptions and the cold stark inherent lack of conversation that FizzBuzz culture introduces to an already non-inclusive profession.

Feedback, comments, code, ideas, brainstorming, discussion, etc all very welcome via any channel. Open an "issue" just to say hello

### FizzBuzz Culture

- What type of organization would ask members or prospective members to take the FizzBuzz test?
- make a fictional company such as: "World Wide Dilbertian Associates Inc" [like this company](http://dilbert.com/strip/2016-10-06)

### FizzBuzz Objectives

- The surface objective of FizzBuzz is to present a simple programming test example that any competent programmer can produce in order to eliminate (as the theory goes) programmers that can't program. Given that the time and effort to administer and evaluate the test exceeds the 5 mins of actually talking to a human being, the entire concept is suspiciously rooted in the pseudo-academic replaceable widgets cogs in the machine culture endemic to all school systems in the Western World. Therefore the underlying social force that drives this monoculture elitist first world thinking must be the actual main objective even if the testing organization is unaware of the poison lurking within.
- Promote your organization as focusing on the [trivial](http://dilbert.com/strip/2016-10-05)
- Ensure all organization members are demoralized by the asymetric power relationship
- Communicate that creativity is not a desirable attribute

### FizzBusted Objectives

- point out the inherent absurdity of FizzBuzz through a "Spinal Tap" type of parody
- educate organizations that 1970's social research ["The Medium is the Message"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message) is still valid today
- although I personally think efforts like "Hour of Code" are based on false assumptions, mocking people with FizzBuzz is logically opposed to encouraging people to adopt programming
- there is a known psychological condition known as "Performance Anxiety" but of course in the usual context of evaluation potential organization members, FizzBuzz is just icing on top of the Horror Cake that is a typical selection process
- testing anything at all inevitably leads to selection based on testing which to the clueless seems like a desired outcome but in the end your are mostly selecting for ability to navigate artificial tests!
- similar to the problem of "testing selection" there is the meta result of "Mono Culture" in an organization. This is why Google has dropped its mythically famous programmer testing which they found (rather obviously IMO) that they ended up with excellent test takers and identical thinkers all talented to a huge degree in those areas but not contributing to the diversity and progress of the organizaton.
