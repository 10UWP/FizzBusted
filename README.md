# FizzBusted
Exploring the mystery of the FizzBuzz Meme and that the Horrors might be in the testers themselves

The idea in germination here is to produce a UWP Demo that challenges the underlying FizzBuzz social assumptions and the cold stark inherent lack of conversation that FizzBuzz culture introduces to an already non-inclusive profession.

Feedback, comments, code, ideas, brainstorming, discussion, etc all very welcome via any channel. Open an "issue" just to say hello

# FizzBuzz Culture

- What type of organization would ask members or prospective members to take the FizzBuzz test?
- make a fictional company such as: "World Wide Dilbertian Associates Inc"

# FizzBuzz Objectives

- Promote your organization as focusing on the trivial
- Ensure all organization members are demoralized by the asymetric power relationship
- Communicate that creativity is not a desirable attribute

# FizzBusted Objectives

- point out the inherent absurdity of FizzBuzz through a "Spinal Tap" type of parody
- educate organizations that 1970's social research "The Medium is the Message" is still valid today

# Misc

- add your ideas
